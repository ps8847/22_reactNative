the steps to how to make apk of our react-native app 

debug vs signed apk 

befor moving to the process of debug apk geenrtaion let's see the difference between debug apk and signed apk 

major difference are the debug flags and signed keys :

    * for debug builds the apk will be signed with the default debug signing keys and debug flag enabled 
    * for release keys you will have to explicitly specify the keys to sign with and the debug flag will be turned off so that it cannot be debugged
    * proguard can be turned on for release builds . (also for debug builds but not advised). this step needs to be done explicitly and is false by default


    Relase apk is the final apk which we willl share with public 

    step1 : open you original cmd of your project location and paste this command :
                keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_key_name.keystore -alias your_key_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

                then fill the fields which they are asking and but note : remember everything >>>  in the end type yes and press enter

            after pressing enter it will generate a file named as " your_key_name.keystore " 

            just copy that file and paste it at   android > app > ... here          and obviously delete it from the root area 

    step2 : now go to android > app > build.gradle 

                    now edit these below : 

                    i) search for the object named as : signingConfigs and edit it as below :
                    
                    signingConfigs {

                            // debug {
                            //     storeFile file('debug.keystore')
                            //     storePassword 'android'
                            //     keyAlias 'androiddebugkey'
                            //     keyPassword 'android'
                            // }

                            release {
                                storeFile file('your_key_name.keystore')
                                storePassword 'your_passsword_your_entred_previously'
                                keyAlias 'your_key_alias'
                                keyPassword 'your_passsword_your_entred_previously'
                                }
                        }

                    ii) now search for the buildtypes > release and change it as below 

                     buildTypes {
                            debug {
                                signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
                            }
                            release {
                                // Caution! In production, you need to generate your own keystore file.
                                // see https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android.
                                // signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
                                signingConfig signingConfigs.release
                                minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
                                proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
                            }
                        }

before going any further, make sure you have an assets folder under android/app/src/main/assets. If itâ€™s not there, create one. 
 also run this below step 3 : npm install -g react-native-cli


step 3 : run this command :  
        react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/

step 4 : run this command : cd android

step 5 : run this command : gradlew assembleRelease                  it will take time ,, if it will give any erorr then deleet the folders named as drawable from android > app > src > main > res > .. from here

step 6 : now after successful build your sharable app will be available at 
            android > app > build > outputs > apk > release > .... your apk
